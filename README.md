# ancient-amigaos-exng2
Ancient AmigaOS C++ framework code. This is a second iteration of the original (https://github.com/0xABADCAFE/ancient-amigaos-exng) which was reworked to use more of the C++ standard, in particular Exceptions (and all the headache that meant for runtime performance and keeping executables as small as possible) and reorganised various facets.

This iteration was successfully expanded into a multiplatform implementation supporting later versions of AmigaOS and Linux. Due to poor backup policy and ageing spinning rust, that code is now lost.

This code is here for posterity.
