# ancient-amigaos-exng2
Ancient AmigaOS C++ framework code. This is a second iteration of the original which added exceptions (and all the headache that meant for keeping executables as small as possible) and reorganised various facets.

This code was successfully expanded into a multiplatform implementation supporting later versions of AmigaOS and Linux. That code is now lost.

This code is here for posterity.
